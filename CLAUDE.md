# Squad Planner - Project Overview

Squad Planner is an open-source web application built entirely in Rust that helps Football Manager players optimize their team selections based on tactical systems and player attributes. Users upload CSV files containing their squad's player data (attributes like passing, pace, tackling, etc.), select a formation (e.g., 4-3-3, 4-4-2), assign specific roles and duties to each position (e.g., Advanced Playmaker on Support, Box-to-Box Midfielder on Attack), and configure tactical instructions (mentality, pressing intensity, width, tempo). The application then uses a weighted attribute scoring algorithm to calculate each player's suitability for their assigned role and automatically generates the optimal starting XI plus a customizable number of substitutes. The frontend is built with Leptos (Rust WebAssembly framework) providing a responsive dashboard with interactive pitch visualization, player lists with filtering/sorting, formation diagrams, and squad depth analysis heat maps. The backend uses Actix-Web for REST APIs and Polars for efficient dataframe operations, with all data persisted in SQLite. Key features include role suitability scoring with percentage ratings, positional depth visualization showing coverage quality per position, player comparison tools with radar charts, squad save/load functionality, PDF/JSON export options, training recommendations based on attribute gaps, and tactical instruction adjustments that dynamically modify attribute weights (e.g., Gegenpress increases importance of Work Rate and Stamina). The project is structured as a Cargo workspace with three crates (backend, frontend, shared) and follows a phased development approach: Phase 1 delivers the MVP with core file upload, formation selection, and squad generation; Phase 2 adds enhanced filtering, depth analysis, and tactical configuration; Phase 3 introduces budget optimization, custom formations, and training recommendations; and Phase 4 explores ML-based features like player potential prediction and similar player clustering.
